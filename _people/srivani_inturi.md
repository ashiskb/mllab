### About
I’m Srivani Inturi, and my area of focus is to study algorithms in Deep Learning with the aim of handling big data with self-improving learning and making decisions whenever it detects a change in pattern. I have a strong background in Big Data, Deep Learning, and Data mining. I was curious to learn how artificial intelligence might advance our understanding of our space during my graduation. I significantly contributed to the detection of ionospheric scintillations and the prediction of TEC that influences GPS radio waves to provide users with an alert system. I have a proven track record of publications in IEEE journals and a patent in this area. Having this expertise gives me enthusiasm to work on applied applications of artificial intelligence on ionospheric physics.
