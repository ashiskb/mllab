### About us
We are a group of computer scientists with interest in theoretical developments of machine learning and deep learning with a practical use-case in mind. Right at the moment, much of the research in the lab is about solving problems in the natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) and responsible AI system design.

### Research
Making sense of data is possibly the biggest problem since the dawn of data science including machine learning and deep learning. As more data crunching algorithms are now being used in many disciplines to push the theoretical capability (if there is any!) of the algorithms and raising concerns on **are we there yet?**. We also build algorithms to analyze data, but with a focus on the bounds and architectural oversight of the algorithms we nurture.

### Lab Members

Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. Our interests span genomics and molecular biology, cybersecurity, cognitive science, education and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](http://ml.cse.ucdenver.edu/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).
